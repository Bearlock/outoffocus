Welcome back! We're supposed to talk about hobbies and time-wasters in this episode
but we're dirty dirty liars and mostly focus on our musical backgrounds, what music we like
and how experienced we are at bass playin' (Spoilers: Erick barely has any while Nick became a music therapist. Do the math.)

Some stuff we talk about:
- How we met
- Jaco Pastorius
- First albums and first concerts
- Getting yelled at in high school by Nick's wife
- Utah Play-for-pay culture
- Dat Bujo \#bulletjournal
