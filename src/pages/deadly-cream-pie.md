Know what goes really well together like Doritos and a long night of drinkin'? Erick and Nick shooting the shit over the airwaves. Welcome back to another episode of Out of Focus. Today Erick enlightens us to a genre of books he wasn't aware of. It's not self-help (although he needs those) and it's not fantasy (Wheel of Time re-read anyone?); it's food-based murder-mystery novels. Books. Filled with murder, mystery, intrigue, and recipes for delicious pastries. What more could a bored middle-aged housewife teleported from the 50's want really?

Nick being the more learned of the two gives us insights into a weird thing he saw on the subway as well as how getting a Master's in Music Therapy goes. Neither sound easy and/or pleasant. Honestly, who puts their pants on inside out and buttons them the normal way? Baffling.
