Welcome back (or hello for the first time)! It's time again for us to charm you with the sweet sultry sounds of our voices.

Today we're focusing on luck and love, but as usual, we get distracted on the way. Our luck discussion quickly becomes stories about childhood injury and strife; as it turns out, neither Nick or Erick should ever ride anything with two wheels. Nor should _anyone_ be allowed to purchase and drink a 3 liter of soda in a single sitting (Hello early onset childhood diabetes!).

We also gab about 4th graders fighting for Nick's affection, our self-proclaimed titles (The Elf King and The Coffee Filter of The Internet), how thots love shin-guards, and how r/relationshipadvice is a messed up place.

Come fall in love with us. Check it out, subscribe to our nonsense, and hit us up on [Twitter][twit] and [Instagram][insta] (\@outoffocusshow).
