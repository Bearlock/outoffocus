Do you enjoy bread and failure first thing on Monday mornings? Do you like globalism and cultural invasions? Does Star Wars just kinda do it for you?

Well then welcome to this yeast-y space nerd episode of Out of Focus. We do our best to deflect criticism by addressing concerns about our lack of knowledge of pao de quijo (and cultures in general). Listen to us gush over our boi [Gus Johnson][gus] as he reaches a million subs, lend us your ear as we spoil (early) Game of Thrones, Star Wars, and other beloved franchises, and harken to us as Nick lays down the law in regards to how he goes about watching movies. It's a lot of work.

Also you'll be witnessing a murder this time around; Nick and Erick compare Memrise scores and here's another spoiler: things don't look too hot for Erick. This leads into Nick revealing his true intentions behind language learning.

Turn off your targeting computer, relish in your nostalgia, and become the senate. Check it out, subscribe to our nonsense, and hit us up on [Twitter][twit] and [Instagram][insta] (\@outoffocusshow).
