Hey again and welcome back salad tossers! Turns out that Nick can do a pretty mean Trump and Obama impression. We start things off in an interesting way by playing a game. Erick quizzes Nick on whether or not a certain subreddit exists. Nick does a pretty damn good job and would probably get an A if this was school. Nick derails the quiz at one point though and essentially plays a mental Rorschach with Erick. Please, tell us (in detail) about what Nick's mental Rorschach makes you think of. 

We're all about learning here. Some things we learned this time around:

- Ranch turns black after 20 years
- Nick has definitely-probably-maybe posted on r/gonewild
- Gene Wilder is sexier than most redditors
- Mold can happen anywhere at any time for any reason
- Erick spends too much time on the internet and is desensitized
- Nick is wholesome. Listen to his r/hydrohomies example

Gently chop up your lettuce, firmly grasp your pepper grinder, and prepare to just drip dressing all over your salad. Check it out, subscribe to our nonsense, and hit us up on [Twitter][twit], [Instagram][insta] (\@outoffocusshow) and [Patreon][patreon].
