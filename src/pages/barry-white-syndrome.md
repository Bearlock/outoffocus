What do you guys do when you're sick? We record a podcast episode! Happy Wednesday folks, welcome back to another humpday OOF episode. Nick is carrying around the heavy burden of disease this time around so make sure to send him your love. We start the episode by indulging in our favorite - tangents! Nick's voice is deep, velvety, and goosebump-inducing (thank you disease). Erick is his usual annoyingly nasal self.

We talk about all sorts of things this time around. Middle-aged bar breakups, the luxury of having a door in New York, and Nick's super secret (and super useful) super power. We also touch upon travel, what makes a house a home, and the best way to reject food you don't want in a foreign country without being rude (spoilers, just tell people you're allergic!). 

You'll find all that and more in this plague-riddled episode of Out of Focus. Check it out, subscribe to our nonsense, and hit us up on [Twitter][twit] and [Instagram][insta] (\@outoffocusshow).
