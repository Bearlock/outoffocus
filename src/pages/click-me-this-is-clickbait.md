15 things about Nick and Erick that'll make you go HUH? Did you click? Did you give us traffic?

Awesome.

Welcome back to another episode of Out of Focus! Today we examine clickbait culture and how it's always been around. Buzzfeed reigns supreme and the only way to get views on Youtube is over-the-top clickbait titles and thumbnails. Something about tragedy of the commons or something.

Eventually we move on and get Nick to take a Buzzfeed quiz. He gets to learn what kind of relationship he deserves. Erick and Nick both find out that they weren't privy to early-to-mid 90's black sitcoms. They both missed out on some culture.
