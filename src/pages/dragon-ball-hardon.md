Another episode recorded on Easter folks. We come in screeching hot with an impromptu slash fiction and very, very quickly blast away to another topic leaving that smouldering crater of an intro. We pivot to talkin' barcades, retro games, and how fun those old beat-em-ups were. Also enjoy the mutual gushing over the Time Crisis series; best arcade shooter of our time!

We're all over the place (which is par for the course). We touch on Wuxia theater and some of our favorite chinese martial arts movies, Dragonball gushing, and some VR gamez talk. There are some technical difficulties at the end so you also get to enjoy the soothing sounds of Erick monologuing.

Put in some quarters, crank out that Konami code, and beat the kill screen. Check it out, subscribe to our nonsense, and hit us up on [Twitter][twit] and [Instagram][insta] (\@outoffocusshow).
