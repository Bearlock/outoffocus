### A Limerick
There once was a man with a quip,  
Who engaged in the Provo Dip,  
He soaked his weird willy   
With a girl who seemed silly,   
And if god found out he would flip. 

Hi and welcome to Wednesday! We're pretty eclectic this episode. We start off by talking about adult fears for a sec and quickly transition to talking about the quirky personality types we ran into growing up. This somehow goes on to become more of us sharing stories and experiences from our youth. Enjoy us wingin' it this time around.

Pull up a chair, forget your fears, and think about how you got where you are. Check it out, subscribe to our nonsense, and hit us up on [Twitter][twit] and [Instagram][insta] (\@outoffocusshow).
