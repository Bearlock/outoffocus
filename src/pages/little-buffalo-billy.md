Would you eat me? I'd eat me.

Welcome back! In this episode of Out of Focus, Nick and Erick talk about cannibalizing kids and discuss strategies on how to pick the best and most tasty ones. You wanna choose a husky sports kid that gets made fun of by their friends.

1. Their flesh is a nice combination of lean meat with solid marbling.
2. Their tears will act as a delicious brine.

Nick and Erick then talk about teaching teenagers and how hard it is, how kids who live in hospitals get the short end of the stick, and how cinnamon toast is white trash. They then go down a sugary cereal-y memory lane and revisit those cereals only #ninetieskids could love.

Get your color-changing spoon, break out the big bowl, and pour yourself a tasty bowl of sugar-frosted OOFs. Check it out, subscribe to our nonsense, and hit us up on [Twitter][twit], [Instagram][insta] (\@outoffocusshow) and [Patreon][patreon].
