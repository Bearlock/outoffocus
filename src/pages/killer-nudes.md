Happy Monday! Welcome to episode 3. On this episode we wax lyrically about how we like to enrich (and waste) our time, how much we like learning languages, and what our deep, ~~dank~~ dark guilty pleasures are.

Some highlights:
- Nick's fountain pen obsession
- Erick's Rule number 1 of the internet: pretend you're a dude.
- The intricacies of the Spanish language.
- Erick secretly loves him some Taylor Swift and Ariana Grande.
- The comedy/music stylings of Bloodhound Gang, Stephen Lynch, Ninja Sex Party, and more.
- Rom-coms are the heroin of movies.
- Nick's Kung Pow validation (and obsession with cows?)
