We're drier than a well in Arizona in the middle of August.

Welcome back anyway! This episode is kinda everywhere and starts with us rehashing jokes we've already done. We're hacks and we're devoid of any sort of comedic integrity. Nick tells us about his lovely weekend and how he caught up with a friend who he hadn't seen in a long time. Turns out people change and friendships are weird.

Erick Tells us about his dark and sordid childhood past with the encounters he had with his nemesis. They fought, they struggled, it ended up with their siblings dating. Who woulda thunk?

Follow Lassie, get yer bucket, and try to draw water from this empty well. Check it out, subscribe to our nonsense, and hit us up on [Twitter][twit], [Instagram][insta] (\@outoffocusshow) and [Patreon][patreon].
