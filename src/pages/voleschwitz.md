Hey there animal lovers, bug haters, and those who have drank deeply from the cup of cringe (or meetings). Happy Wednesday.

Today's episode is a dive into a couple things that make our skin crawl, primarily cringe and meetings. Listen to Nick as he regales us with stories of Reggie Watts sampling Texan locusts, lying sound guys and how that can lead to embarrassment in front of hundreds (if not thousands), and how talking about vole massacres in front of god and the world is probably not the best thing to bring up in a work meeting.

Erick also contributes by talking more bug stories, his belligerence towards meetings in general, and how homophobic co-workers cause everyone in the company to go through sensitivity training.

Come cringe with us, be kind to all living things, and send us your weird stories. Check it out, subscribe to our nonsense, and hit us up on [Twitter][twit] and [Instagram][insta] (\@outoffocusshow).
