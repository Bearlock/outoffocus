Hey there thieves and liars; welcome back to another Wednesday episode of Out of Focus. Also, it's our tenth episode! If you've stuck around this long we want you to know our gratitude. We're sincerely touched and grateful that you folks choose to waste your time with us. Thanks for being around, being awesome, and listening to us shoot the breeze.

Today's episode once again features the one and only Chelsea Farr! She's here to talk with us about murder podcasts, criminals we know, and crimes we ourselves have committed. Erick goes in deep about his shoplifting crime spree as a teenager, having dinner with bank robbers, and having once had a crush on a girl whose parents were human traffickers. Nick knows no such people and continues to be our favorite squeaky clean music therapist. Chelsea on the other hand let's us know about her cocaine connections, gives us the rundown on how to smuggle drugs via boat, and talks about how the 80's were the best of times and the worst of times. Depends on if you were a serial killer.

Listen to us crack a few cold cases (of beer!). Check it out, subscribe to our nonsense, and hit us up on [Twitter][twit] and [Instagram][insta] (\@outoffocusshow). Also check out Chelsea's stuff on her insta [here][chelseainsta] (\@thechelsfarr).
