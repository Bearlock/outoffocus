Wednesday, hump day, middle of the week - we're gonna talk some more, wanna take a peek? Er, listen, I guess. I dunno - I'm no good at rhyming.

Today's episode focuses on the nerd-game-supreme (and one of the world's largest concentrations of salt), League of Legends. Nick walks us through game winning strats, how to best piss off friends and foe alike, and why the hell he continues to play it. He's gonna go semi-pro any day now. 

We also take time to touch upon some of our favorite ways to eat and still maintain our girlish figures. Eating a ridiculous amount of potatoes somehow comes into the equation. Come sit down and waste ~~away~~ an hour with us.
