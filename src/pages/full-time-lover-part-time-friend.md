Hello for the first time and welcome to the first episode of our show! In our inaugural
episode we talk a bit about us; who we are, where we're from, and some of the
"why" in regards to the podcast.

Some of the things we talk about include:
- Software Engineering
- Music(al) Therapy
- Nick's asshole cat and how Nick copes with the abuse
- Gin shots and how they're a bad idea
- And some more bullshit
